Standard CAT
============

CATs are humanoid combat units that can carry :doc:`/weapons` and are outfitted with head-mounted :doc:`Disc </discs>` and :doc:`Grenade </grenades>` launchers. 

The name "CAT" (short for `catenate <http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/catenate>`_) comes from the fact that it's the only form with the ability to capture territory zones in :doc:`/modes/eth`.

Health
------

Standard CATs have 75 health points. Health is lost if a CAT takes more damage than its damage buffer can absorb or if it's hit by a weapon that by-passes the damage buffer. If a CAT loses all its health, the CAT is erased and depending on game mode, its controlling player is forced into :doc:`/forms/etherform`.

Damage Buffer
-------------

Standard CATs have a 25 point damage buffer. The buffer constantly recharges back to 25 points.

Damage Damper
-------------

The damage damper is a CAT's first line of protection. If full, it reduces damage by 50%. The damage reduction decreases in a linear fashion with decreased damage damper levels.

Or to put it another way: The lower your damage damper is, the more damage you take. 

Note: A lot of weapons draw power away from the damage damper when fired, so it's generally a bad idea to fire weapons indiscriminately.

Impulse Damper
--------------

The impulse damper works similar to the damage damper, except reducing impulses instead of damage and reducing impulse by 75% if full. Modules that draw power away from the impulse damper when used are the :doc:`/modules/etherboard` and the :doc:`/modules/xjump`.


Additional Modules
------------------

Depending on game mode and loadout, CATs are outfitted with modules that extend the CAT's abilities. See the :doc:`/modules` section for an overview of all existing modules.

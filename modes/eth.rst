Ethernet Mode
=============

Ethernet maps contain rectangular zones and two teams fight over control of these zones. Players can exist in different forms: The flying, indestructible :doc:`/forms/etherform` and humanoid, weapon-wielding physical manifestations called CATs.

Players start out in Etherform and need to find a zone owned by their team in order to manifest as a CAT. As CAT, players can capture zones connected to their existing zones by being inside the zone while no enemy CAT is also present in the zone. The zone then turns a different color, depending on which team captured it. If CATs of both teams are present, the zone remains neutral. CATs can enter enemy zones that are not connected to their team's zones to prevent the enemy from manifesting in that zone. Such blocked zones are distinguished from normal zones by blinking.

The game is won if one team has captured all zones. 

Classes
-------

In Etherform, players can choose between four different CAT classes. If the selected class does not have enough health to manifest, players can regenerate the selected class' health by spending time inside one of their team's zones in Etherform. If the selected class is at full health but other classes are not, the health regeneration is distributed evenly over all classes that are not at full health.

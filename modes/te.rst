Team Elimination Mode
=====================

Team Elimination is a very simple round-based mode where two teams fight until one team has been completely eliminated.
At the start of each round, all players spawn as :doc:`/forms/standardcat` with a fixed loadout. If a CAT is destroyed or
switches back to :doc:`/forms/etherform` manually, it can not re-manifest until the beginning of the next round, when it will
manifest automatically.

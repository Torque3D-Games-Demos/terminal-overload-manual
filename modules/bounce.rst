B.O.U.N.C.E.
============

When activated, the B.O.U.N.C.E. will scan for enemies within a short radius, reverse their momentum and hit them with a 6000 point impulse pointing away from the user.

If the B.O.U.N.C.E. is unable to find any enemies in range, using it will drain 50 points from the user's damage damper.

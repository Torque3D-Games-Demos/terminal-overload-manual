Stealth
=======

The stealth module allows a CAT to become temporarily undetectable to weapons that are able to by-pass a CAT's damage buffer (currently the :doc:`/weapons/sr2` and the :doc:`/grenades/g1`).

The stealth module will activate automatically if the CAT is hit by a weapon that can by-pass a CAT's damage buffer.

CATs with an activated stealth module will appear the be flickering.

X-Jump
======

The X-Jump module allows a CAT to propel itself away from its surrounding surfaces. Imagine jumping off every surrounding surface at the same time.

The module can be charged (default: left alt) or activated instantly (default: space).

The strength of the jump increases based on the speed of the CAT using it.

When used, the X-Jump module drains power away from the user's impulse damper.
